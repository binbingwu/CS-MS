(a)

When an observer object is asked to update itself, it can be passed the particular subject object that had changed.

So, rather than just update() in the observer, change the method to update( Subject ).

(b)

Just prior to deleting the subject, each observer object should be notified of that, and do what's appropriate.

So, add a detach() method in each observer to be called just prior to the actual deletion of the subject.
